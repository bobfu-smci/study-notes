## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

Console is the interface that users interact with systems through. 
In the old days, computers were expensive and many users shared one and accessed it by terminals, 
which were composed of small screens and teletypewriters (TTY). 
Nowadays it has become legacy but we can still see it on common OS. 
There are also pseudo TTYs shown when people access consoles in GUI desktop, or operate remote machines by SSH. 
On embedded systems, it's common that developers type commands through serial port interface (UART).
